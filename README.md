# 📖 Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day. Approving high-risk applicants increases financial losses, while rejecting reliable applicants reduces business opportunities.

This project implements a **production-style Credit Risk Assessment System** that predicts whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan using demographic, financial, bureau, and previous application data.

The repository demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment using FastAPI and Streamlit.

- Reduce financial losses
- Improve underwriting decisions
- Identify risky applicants
- Support data-driven lending
- Improve portfolio quality

# 🤖 Model Development

Models compared:

| Model | ROC-AUC |
|--------|--------:|
| Random Forest | 0.698 |
| XGBoost | 0.721 |
| CatBoost | 0.733 |
| **LightGBM (Selected)** | **0.7405** |

LightGBM was selected after Optuna hyperparameter optimization.

# 📈 Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|------:|
| ROC-AUC | **0.7405** |
| Accuracy | 0.70 |
| Precision | 0.16 |
| Recall | **0.66** |
| F1-score | 0.26 |

> **Note:** Because the dataset is imbalanced, ROC-AUC and Recall were prioritized over Accuracy.

### Class Imbalance

Two approaches were evaluated:

- Class Weights ✅ (Selected)
- SMOTE

Class weights achieved better minority-class recall than SMOTE.

# 🔍 SHAP Explainability

SHAP was used to:

- Explain individual predictions
- Measure feature importance
- Increase model transparency
- Improve trust in predictions

---

# 🚀 API

**Endpoint**
